# Ismorphic-String-Check

##Check length of both the strings.
##If strings are of not equal length then return false
##Create a character map use characters from string 1 as key and map it with string 2
##While iterating over the string if string 1’s character does not exist in the hash map then add it to the hash map and map it to the string 2’s value. If it exists then compare it with the string 2’s character
